<P><B><I>What is MSX?</I></B><BR>
<p>
  MSX is an old Z80-based family of home computers which appeared in autumn 1983
as an attempt to establish a single standard in home computing similar to
VHS in video. They were popular in Asian (Korea, Japan) and South American
(Brazil, Chile) countries as well as in Europe (Netherlands, France,
Spain) and former Soviet Union, but they are virtually unknown in USA.
Although the MSX standard quietly died from year 1988, the world got to see
MSX2, MSX2+ and TurboR extensions of it.

<p>
  The MSX standard has been designed by a company called ASCII in
Cooperation with Microsoft which provided a firmware version of its BASIC
for the machine. Because this BASIC version was an extended version of MicroSoft
Basic, it was called "MicroSoft eXtended BASIC". This explains the name "MSX".
The system thanks his name to the built-in BASIC.
<P>
Note that according to Kazuhiko Nishi, the `inventor' of the whole MSX idea,
MSX can mean a lot more than just MicroSoft eXtended. He says
(published in an article in a Japanese business magazine in 1997) that he used
the abbreviation MSX to contract a lot of companies saying that it means
Matsushita Sony X-machine in which the X could stand for the company Nishi was
talking with at that moment. He also said that he initially wanted to name it
NSX, Nishi Sony X (or MNX, Matsushita Nishi X) but the name NSX was already taken by Honda. So, in the case
of Microsoft he just said the MS stands for MicroSoft. Anyhow, at least it is
clear that Matsushita and Sony are the most important companies that produced
MSX machines and hardware, according to Nishi.
<P>
Other possibilities were Matsushita Sony Shake-hands (X). But actually, MSX
doesn't really have a meaning, it's just a nice-sounding 3-letter combination.
On the MSX fair in Tilburg (21st April) 2001, Nishi gave a general meaning:
Machines (hardware) with Software eXchangeability. A funny remark was that when
MSX seemed to be succesful, Microsoft said MS in MSX means MicroSoft, but after
1986, when MSX seemed not as succesful as Microsoft had hoped, they denied
that...
<P>
The MSX machines were produced by such giants as
Sony, Yamaha, Panasonic, Toshiba, Daewoo, and Philips. The only MSX model
ever sold in USA appears to be an early SpectraVideo machine (and possibly some Yamaha CX-5M machines, which were merely sold as musical instruments...)
<P>
  In spite of its sad history, MSX is a very nice computer, especially
useful for educational purposes which is clearly indicated by example of
the Soviet Union. Russian Ministry of Education bought hundreds of MSXes
(and later MSX2s) grouped into "computerized classroom systems" of 10-16
machines connected into a simple network. Entire generation of programmers
has grown up using these computers.
<p>
  Hardware-wise, MSX represents a hybride of a videogame console and a
generic CP/M-80 machine. Its heart is a Z80 CPU working at 3.58MHz in the
base model. The clock frequency has been doubled in the TurboR. The video
subsystem is built around a TMS9918 or TMS9928 VDP chip also used in Texas
Instruments' TI-99/4 computers, ColecoVision, and Coleco Adam. In the
later MSX models this chip has been upgraded to V9938 (MSX2) and V9958
(MSX2+ and TurboR). The latest version of it is V9990. The audio system is
handled by AY-3-8910 chip by General Instruments, same as the one used in
Sinclair ZXSpectrum128 audio. AY-3-8910 provides 3 channels of synthesized
sound, noise generation, and two general purpose parallel IO ports which
are used for joysticks and some other things in the MSX design. Due to
their hardware structure, MSX machines were perfectly suitable for games
and there is a lot of good games either written or ported to them.
<P>
Nowadays, there exist a lot of expansions on the MSX system, such as the
Moonsound card, based on OPL4, the GFX9000 card (based on the aforementioned V9990), SCSI and IDE interfaces, etc.
