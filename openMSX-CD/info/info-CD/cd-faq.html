<h1>The openMSX-CD FAQ</h1>

<p class="question" >I burned the CD, but it won't boot.</p>
<p class="answer" >Check the BIOS to see if your PC boots from CD, probably your PC first boot from floppy and HD before checking to see if it must boot from CD, or maybe you need to press a key to enter a boot-menu during yours PC boot-up sequence to select the CD to boot from.<br>Some older BIOS's have trouble with the 'no-bootdisk-emulation' way the openMSX-CD uses to autoboot, in such case an upgrade of you bios might help.</p>

<p class="question" >Will using this CD alter something on my hard disk?</p>
<p class="answer" >No, normal usage will not alter anything on your disk. Only if you are creating your own personalized version of this CD the programs will change your disk content. See the remastering chapter in the document for more info.</p>

<p class="question" >How do I select MSX cartridges/disk-images that I have stored on my HD to run them in openMSX?</p>
<p class="answer" >The simplest way is to select the Catapult from the launcher-menu and then browse to the /mnt. The directories there represent all recognized partitions + filesystems on your disks.<br>
The text based menu also has a way to select files from arbitrary directories, but the text based interface is verry un-intuitive </p>

<p class="question" >Help, I can't find my C: drive when booted from CD</p>
<p class="answer" > Since this is a live Linux CD, your disks are represent in the Linux way. Instead of using letters like C,D,E and so on, they are called hda,hdb,hdc and hdd for IDE disks and sda,sdb,sdc etc for SCSI disks. Each partition number is appended to this name. For an indept explication of this naming convention and its full meaning consult some Linux beginners guide, or some local Linux user.<br>
In most cases your C: is called hda1 and can be found in /mnt/hda1 when using this CD.

<p class="question" >The soundvolume is way too loud/silent</p>
<p class="answer" >Once the CD has booted beond the splash screens you can press the keys &lt;CTRL&gt; + &lt;ALT&gt; + &lt;F4&gt; at the same time to switch to a simple text based equalizer. use to cursos keys up/down to select and right/left to change the settings. Once the volume is corrected press &lt;ALT&gt; + &lt;F5&gt; to get back to the menu/openMSX</p>

<p class="question" >The CD boots fine and I get into the menu's, but openMSX won't start</p>
<p class="answer" >This could happen if your soundcard isn't autodetected. openMSx requires a functional soundcard, and will refuse to start if no soundcard is found.<br>
Sometimes there are troubles with going fullscreen, try launching openMSx in windowed mode.</p>

<p class="question" >I simply want to play <i>&lt;insert programname here&gt;</i>. Is there a way to skip all those menu's?</p>
<p class="answer" >
See <a href="cd-bootoptions.html">this page</a> for an explication of the available bootoptions. Using these you can directly start a program that is on the CD. Closing openMSX in such case will also turn off the computer in such case.

<p class="question" >Remastering: I created the flag file but the openMSX-CD doesn't find it</p>
<p class="answer" >If you are sure that the file is in all lower-case as described in the remaster steps, then you are probably using a filesystem that is not write supported by the openMSX-CD. For instance a lot of Windows XP installations use NTFS instead of the old vfat file system. Since Microsoft doesn't release the specifications of NTFS, the Linux programmers can not safely develop programs to write on those disks, because of the corruption danger. Try repartitioning your HD with tools like partition magic and create an extra vfat formated disk</p>

<p class="question" >Remastering: The remastering proces says it found more then one flag-file.</p>
<p class="answer" >The two major posibilities here are:<ul><li>there are flags remain from a previous remastering you performed<li>You are using a setup with mirrorred disks. If this raid configuration is not detected/activated by the openMSX-CD the openMSX-CD will see the original and mirrored flag-file as two seperate flag files and refuse to start the remaster process.</ul></p>
