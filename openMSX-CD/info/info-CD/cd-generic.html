<h1 >What is the openMSX-CD</h1>
<p>The openMSX CD is a modified KNOPPIX CD
which is intended to allow people to try out the openMSX emulator
without the need to install any software on their computer.</p>
<h1>Why does the openMSX-CD exist</h1>
<p>When the openMSX project was started all the main developers used the Linux OS as their main development environment. This ment that most regular users were not able to get aqcuanted with openMSX since there was no binary for other OSes available.</p>
<p>To resolve this situation the idea of a life Linux CD was born.<br>
Due to the growing popularity of the Knoppix and it's faboulus hardware autodetection, it was decided that this should be the base for a the openMSX-CD.</p>
<p>Since we now also officially support Win32, the openMSX-CD also contains a Catapult and openMSX version for win32 platforms. These are custom versions for the openMSX-CD so that you do not need to install openMSX on the machine. As an extra a special loader for the Cd was produced so that a nice autorun feature on Win32 platforms could be made possible</p>
<h1>features of this release</h1>
