<h1 >Boot options</h1>
<p>Since the openMSX CD is a modified <a href="../../KNOPPIX/index.html">KNOPPIX CD</a> (version 3.7) the bootoptions available for Knoppix are also available for the openMSX-CD. For the default available options look at <a href="../../KNOPPIX/knoppix-cheatcodes.txt">this page</a>.<br>
However due to the specific needs of the openMSX-CD a number of extra boot options are created. This is the list of those extra parameters and their effect.</p>

<h2>Generic extra's</h2>
<p class="bootparam" >nobgm</p>
<p>using this parameter will prevent the background music to be played during the hardware autodetection and during the textmenu.</p>
<p>The original Knoppix boot options 'noaudio' and 'nosound' are still active, these however prevent the autoconfiguration of your audiohardware. If you would use these, then openMSX will not launcg due to missing soundhardware.
<p class="bootline" >msx nobgm</p>

<p class="bootparam" >nosplash</p>
If you do not like the pictures during the auto hardware detection, or you would simply like to see this detection in action, use this parameter.
<p class="bootline" >msx nosplash</p>

<p class="bootparam" >splashid</p>
Normal splash pictures are depending on the day of the month, if you want to see a specific picture from all the choises you have you can use this parameter. Simply state the first character of the filename. The available splashscreens are located in /KNOPPIX/splash. Ofcourse this option is overruled by the nosplash option.
<p class="bootline" >msx splashid=1</p>


<h2>Starting the emulation</h2>
The following bootoptions will immediately launch a session of openMSX.<br>
You will not see the launcher selection menu's but immediately a full screen openMSX will be started.
You do not have to specify all the parameters, unspecified parameters will be set to a default value in such case.

<p class="bootparam" >machine</p>
<p>Use &quot;machine=<i>MACHINENAME</i>&quot; where <i>MACHINENAME</i> is the directory name that can be found in /opt/openMSX/share/machine/.
<br>For instance if you whish to auto start a Philips NMS8245 you should give as boot command :</p>
<p class="bootline" >msx machine=Philips_NMS_8245</p>
<p>The default value of this parameter is "msx2".</p>

<p class="bootparam" >ext</p>
<p>Use &quot;ext=<i>EXTENTION</i>&quot; where <i>EXTENTION</i> is the directory name that can be found in /opt/openMSX/share/extensions/ . You can specify multiple extentions by given a comma-seperated list to the ext parameter.
<br>For instance if you whish to auto start a Philips NMS8245 with a moonsound and an audio cartridge you should give as boot command :</p>
<p class="bootline" >msx machine=Philips_NMS_8245 ext=moonsound,audio</p>
<p>By default this parameter is empty.</p>

<p class="bootparam" >cart</p>
<p>Use &quot;cart=<i>CART</i>&quot; where <i>CART</i> is the cartridge you want to use in the emulated MSX.</p>
<p>You can specify the full pathname to the cartridge like this:</p>
<p class="bootline" >msx cart=/openMSX/SOFTWARE/downloaded/msxdev04/seleniak/seleniak.rom<p>
<p>Notice that you have to write this the unix way, meaning that you have to use a slash and not a backslash<br>
<br>You can specify the cartridge by simply giving the filename, in this case the bootprocess will look for the file (with an optional .gz extention) in all the subdirs on the CD, so if you specify ext=game1.rom the first file named game1.rom or game1.rom.gz will be used. If the file is not found on the CD you will be asked if this files must be found on your harddisk.</p>
<p>By default this parameter is empty.</p>

<p class="bootparam" >disk</p>
<p>Use &quot;disk=<i>DISK</i>&quot; where <i>DISK</i> is the diskimage you want to use in the emulated MSX.</p>
<p>The same way of looking for files will be used as described in the 'cart' bootparameter section.<p>
<p>You could also use th eral floppy drive of your computer by using the linux device name of your diskdrive. For instance on most computers the first diskdrive will be called /dev/fd0, the second one /dev/fd1 and so on.
If you have a diskdrive that is connect to your ide bus, this could be /dev/hdc. Ask your local linux user to help you out in case of doubt.<p>
<p> Using the /dev/fd0 as disk parameter requires that you have a disk in your drive when openMSX launches. Otherwise the emulator will not be able to open the disk for reading and close with an error. and your PC will be shutdown. therfore if you use the disk=/dev/fd0 construct the launcher will check if you have inserted a disk, and prompt you to do so in case of absence of a disk.<p>
<p> If you would however like openMSX to boot even if no floppy is inserted you could replace the /dev/ part of the name with /try/. IN this scenario the launcher will check if a floppy is in your drive, if it is openMSX will be launched using the /dev/<i>devicename</i>, if no floppy is present the disk parameter will be ignored.
This was done so that you could remaster the openMSX-CD to have it work as you'ld expect from a real MSX: Simply boot if no floppy is inserted, otherwise boot from the floppy.</p>
<p>By default value parameter is empty.</p>
