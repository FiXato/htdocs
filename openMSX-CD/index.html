<H1>OpenMSX-CD v3.1 is released</H1>
<P>At the Bussum 2005 fair the latest version of
the openMSX-CD was introduced to the public. Due to <A HREF="#troubles">technical
issues</A> there were last minute upgrade trouble with the
creation of the binary packages for the CD. Since solving these
issues took up so much time, there wasn't any time left to
prepare any promotional material. No flyers, no posters, no free
openMSX-CD handouts. All that was visible at the openMSX stand
was <a href="http://www.auroramsx.nl/shoots/Bussum2005/18.jpg">a small handwritten piece of paper</a> stating: &quot;
openMSX-CD: Ask info here&quot; This left the introduction of the
new CD pass by with little attention.
</P>
<P>In order to correct this situation and give the non Bussum
visitors a change to learn about the new version this page is now
available.

<P>This page will give you a quick overview of

<P class="shot"><A HREF="autorun.png"><IMG SRC="autorun-s.png" ALT="Windows auto-run" WIDTH=765 HEIGHT=640 ></A><br>This is the win32 auto-run feature
in action. It opens a browser with extra info and a menu to
install or run the win32 catapult/openMSX combo.

<H2><A NAME="tour"></A>A short tour of the booted CD</H2>

<P class="shot"><IMG SRC="1.png" ALT="Welcome screen" WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480 ><br>When you boot the CD this is the welcome screen.</P>

<P class="shot"><IMG SRC="2.png" ALT="F2 intro text"  WIDTH=720 HEIGHT=400 ><BR>Pressing F2 introduces you to this little piece of text.</P>

<P class="shot"><IMG SRC="3.png" ALT="Boot options" WIDTH=720 HEIGHT=400 ><BR>Since the openMSX-CD is Knoppix based most Knoppix boot
parameters are valid, but some special ones are created for this
CD.</P>

<P class="shot"><IMG SRC="boot.png" ALT="Booting with a cool font" WIDTH=720 HEIGHT=400 ><BR>When the actual Linux kernel is booted you'll see the
text above. Note that the font is altered into a certain
other font type that we all know and love (thanks to Manuel
Bilderbeek for creating the console font). Thanks to changes in
the hardware detection scripts, you will get some nice random
background music as soon as the sound hardware is configured.
Click <A HREF="midi">here</A> to obtain some of the included MIDI
files.</P>

<P class="shot"><A HREF="launcher.png"><IMG SRC="launcher-s.png" ALT="Launchers" WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480 ></A><BR>Once the graphical environment is launched you can pick
your preferred openMSX launcher. Since openMSX-CD v3.1 the cd now
also includes some nice pictures of (most of) the main openMSX
developers.</P>

pick one of the names at this image.</P>

<P class="shot"><A HREF="hegega.png"><IMG SRC="hegega-s.png" ALT="Catapult and blackbox" WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480 ></A><br>If you choose Catapult then you'll see that a nice Blackbox
window manager is started and that the Linux version of catapult
is shown. Closing the Catapult window will shutdown the
openMSX-CD.</P>

you'll end up in this screen. But first a small introduction text
is shown.

<P class="shot"><A HREF="firstautoscreen.png"><IMG SRC="firstautoscreen-s.png" ALT="Text menu" WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480 ></A><BR>After this the real text based menu is shown.</P>

<P class="shot"><IMG SRC="menuoptions.png" ALT="Menu options" WIDTH=384 HEIGHT=233 ><BR>Altering the menu settings allows you to alter stuff like
the time out of the menu's. Set this to an insane high number if
you do not want this to happen. <BR>Menu checks for TCL scripts:
some programs on this CD contain an extra script to automate
certain behaviour when running. For instance the Sphere demo will
be run and automatically the second disk will be inserted by the
TCL script, and to speed up the loading the setting 'throttle
off' will be enabled during the load time of the demo. <BR>Display
readme.1st files: when launching programs the menu will look if
there is an accompanying text file for the program, and display
this file before the actual emulation starts.</P>

<P class="shot"><IMG SRC="softdb.png" ALT="Software database" WIDTH=384 HEIGHT=248 ><BR>By using the software DB of you can drill down your
selection by using a combination of several criteria, as shown
below.</P>

<P class="shot"><A HREF="afterselection.png"><IMG SRC="afterselection-s.png" ALT="Selection" WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480 ></A><BR>And this is the result of the selection.<BR>Note that by
using the DB the menu will warn you if you have selected the
wrong MSX type or extensions. You can replace your current
selection by the settings in the database, or select item by item
if you want to keep your current selection instead of the default
settings suggested by the database. For instance the database
could suggest an MSX2 when you selected Nemesis 3, but you do not
want to see the colour cycling so you prefer to keep the selected
MSX1 model. Or you absolutely want to hear Aleste only with PSG
music and refuse to have the FM-PAC extension added.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Where"></A>Where to get the
CD</H2>

<P>For the moment the CD isn't available online. If you want
to obtain a copy, contact the openMSX team at the next MSX fair,
or mail me at &quot;dhran&nbsp;@&nbsp;scarlet&nbsp;.&nbsp;be&quot;</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="troubles"></A>The current openMSX-CD is still based
upon Knoppix 3.7 and thus still uses the old gnu c++ ABI, the
latest version of openMSX 0.5.2 triggered some compiler bugs, but
compiling it with a newer GCC caused the new binary to use the
new ABI, thus making it segfault since the libraries still used
the old ABI.
