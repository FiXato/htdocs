    <p>
      On this page you will find some 3rd party material that is related to
      openMSX, but not written by the openMSX authors. This also means that
      the openMSX authors do not support it, nor keep it up to date, as it is
      unofficial. But it can be very interesting for our users and we also
      like it very much that people write applications around openMSX or write
      extra documentation. Keep up the good work, people!

      Oh, and if there's some interesting stuff we missed, please let us know!

        Because the old style Catapult does not run (properly) on Mac,
        an active Japanese emulator user/programmer wrote an openMSX
        variant of his NekoLauncher series. It looks like a simple launcher,
        but also seems to be very user friendly.

      <dd>
        For the same reason, Cesco made another launcher for openMSX on OS X.
        It seems to be focused mainly on games and features image previews.

        This article on The MSX Games Box (now part of Passion MSX) explains
        the compilation process of openMSX on MacOS X in great detail, however,
        it is now mostly outdated.

        FiXato created a great web site which provides you with daily built
        binaries of openMSX. Very much recommended if you want to try out
        development versions of openMSX without compiling them yourself!
        Currently supporting Windows and Mac OS X platforms.

      <dd>
        Rafael Jannone made an interesting thing: a plugin for Gedit, so that
        you can easily test your MSX Basic programs in openMSX, while using
        the Gedit text editor. He wrote a whole load of Python scripts to
        make this possible. They might be nice to reuse for other apps!
