    <h1>3rd Party</h1>
    <p>
      On this page you will find some 3rd party material that is related to
      openMSX, but not written by the openMSX authors. This also means that
      the openMSX authors do not support it, nor keep it up to date, as it is
      unofficial. But it can be very interesting for our users and we also
      like it very much that people write applications around openMSX or write
      extra documentation. Keep up the good work, people!

      Oh, and if there's some interesting stuff we missed, please let us know!

        Because the old style Catapult does not run (properly) on Mac,
	an active Japanese emulator user/programmer wrote an openMSX
	variant of his NekoLauncher series. It loos like a simple launcher,
	but also very user friendly.

        Rafael Jannone made an interesting thing: a plugin for Gedit, so that
	you can easily test your MSX Basic programs in openMSX, while using
	the Gedit text editor. He wrote a whole load of Python scripts to 
	make this possible. They might be nice to reuse for other apps!
