		<TD>Wouter</TD>
		<TD>openMSX crashes with 'pure virtual method called' once in a while... Wouter found this: an Alarm object is deleted in main thread while it's being used in another thread. It triggers the delayed draw (the same thing that triggers the black flashes on some machines). <b>PLEASE TEST!</b>

		<TD>Catapult: IPS patches broken</TD>
		<TD>	<FONT color="green">Done</FONT>
		</TD>
		<TD>Herman, Manuel</TD>
		<TD>	implement a proper way to use IPS patches and ROM types without the 'comma notation'. This needs real work on the GUI. This is critical,
because the current Catapult is broken for this: if one select an IPS patch, it will be added to the file in the combobox with the comma notation, which is not implemented in openMSX. Hence: this won't work. Also the romtype selection will use the now deprecated comma notation. On top of that: it looks very ugly to have this whole (deprecated) command line notation inside the GUI's combobox, IMO! </b>

		<TD>integration of SVI-3x8 and Colecovision emulation</TD>
		<TD>	<FONT color="red">Not&nbsp;done</FONT>
		</TD>
		<TD>Maarten</TD>
		<TD>Code is written but not integrated into openMSX yet. Needs quite some work. Might get postponed...

	<TR>
		<TD>Console not usable after ALT-Enter</TD>
		<TD>	<FONT color="red">Not&nbsp;done</FONT>
		</TD>
		<TD>Wouter</TD>
		<TD>After pressing ALt-Enter for full screen, the Enter key seems to hang, which makes the console unusable (it doesn't come up)
		</TD>
		<TD>2005-02-06 (UTC)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Black flashes in SDLGL</TD>
		<TD>	<FONT color="blue">In&nbsp;progress</FONT>
		</TD>
		<TD>Wouter/Maarten</TD>
		<TD>In SDLGL, there are black flashes all over the screen, in some situations. It is related to repaintDelayed, which is used for the icon/console fade animations.
		</TD>
		<TD>2005-02-06 (UTC)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>"Double screen" effect in deinterlacer</TD>
		<TD>	<FONT color="blue">In&nbsp;progress</FONT>
		</TD>
		<TD>Wouter/Maarten</TD>
		<TD>When using the deinterlacer, you can see a 'double screen' after the NOP dice logo in UR. Some info: on the left, it shows the NOP dice. On the right, it shows the MSX boot screen. The NOP dice are compacted (256 pixels wide, not doubled as usual), the MSX boot screen is in its usual resolution (so the left part is missing) and every other line is black. It looks like scanline 100, but I set scanline 0. There is no way the MSX can produce this screen, so it must be a video postprocessing error.
		</TD>

	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Penguin Adventure crashes (sometimes?) on VG 8020/20</TD>
		<TD>	Postpone
		</TD>
		<TD>Maarten</TD>
		<TD>investigated it: the game first initialised the mapper reg save locations (F0F1 and above) and later erases them again. If the game would do those two things in the opposite order, it wouldn't crash. It's heavily timing related. Pressing a key during boot makes the game not crash also.
		</TD>
		<TD>2005-02-06 (UTC)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>ROMType names in romdb.xml need update</TD>
		<TD>	<FONT color="green">Done</FONT>
		</TD>
		<TD>Manuel</TD>
		<TD>	Update the ROMtype names to their new ones.
		</TD>
		<TD>2005-01-24 (UTC)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Finalize new LEDs</TD>
		<TD>	<FONT color="green">Done</FONT>
		</TD>
		<TD>David</TD>
		<TD> I propose to use set1 as default, with the LEDs on the left side arranged vertically, in stead on the top arranged horizontally. This way they're more out of the real MSX screen area. David proposes to put them at the bottom of the screen, closes to where the real MSX would have been. The request to make the LEDs configurable in the machine config files has been acknowledged, but is postponed until after this release.
		</TD>
		<TD>2005-02-02 (UTC)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>256kB sampleRAM in Almost Real</TD>
		<TD>	Postpone	
		</TD>
		<TD>Wouter?</TD>
		<TD>Almost Real should report 256kB sampleRAM at the start. It does not. Using the same hardware config, the sampleRAM is used in Unknown Reality though, so it does work there.
		</TD>
		<TD>2005-01-26 (UTC)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>consolebackground</TD>
		<TD>	<FONT color="green">Done</FONT>
		</TD>
		<TD>Wouter</TD>
		<TD>Setting a console background doesn't work when using relative paths. I found the right PNG in the console via TAB completion, but still it says: "not found in this context".
