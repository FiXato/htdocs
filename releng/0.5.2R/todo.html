		<TD> 	The new MSXtar functionality is not ready for release yet. Proposed fix: disable the commands to use it for now. UPDATE: we decided to not disable it, but just test it heavily, as it has no influence on the rest of openMSX. So, please test!!!

	<TR>
		<TD>3 small bug fixes in Catapult</TD>
		<TD>	<FONT color="red">Not&nbsp;Done</FONT>
		</TD>
		<TD>Herman</TD>
		<TD> I don't know which ones he means, but he said so on IRC :) One of them seems: printer path add slashes (quoted from Patrick).
		</TD>
		<TD>2005-05-02 (UTC)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Add multipage scrolling in character modes for V9958</TD>
		<TD>	<FONT color="red">Not&nbsp;Done</FONT>
		</TD>
		<TD>Maarten</TD>
		<TD> A.k.a. the F-Nano 2 patch
		</TD>
		<TD>2005-04-30 (UTC)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Detect presence of DirectX headers and make it a component in the build system</TD>
		<TD>	<FONT color="red">Not&nbsp;Done</FONT>
		</TD>
		<TD>Maarten</TD>
		<TD> Enhance the build files to check if DirectX headers are available. If not, don't build with DirectX Sound driver. In other words: make it a component like openGL support.
		</TD>
		<TD>2005-04-30 (UTC)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Mac OS X binary package</TD>
		<TD>	<FONT color="blue">In&nbsp;Progress</FONT>
		</TD>
		<TD>Maarten/Herman</TD>
		<TD>	Make a binary package that the OS X users are accustomed to :) For Catapult: fix 1) doesn't remember settings 2) menubar empty 3) segfault on quit.
		</TD>
		<TD>2005-05-02 (UTC)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>New openMSX/Catapult icon</TD>
		<TD>	<FONT color="red">Not&nbsp;Done</FONT>
		</TD>
		<TD>Eric/Herman</TD>
		<TD> Design a new icon, similar to the new Catapult logo (which still needs to be downscaled and integrated!)
		</TD>
		<TD>2005-04-30 (UTC)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Remove broken Konami's Synthesizer from ROMdb</TD>
		<TD>	<FONT color="green">Done</FONT>
		</TD>
		<TD>Patrick</TD>
		<TD> We shouldn't have really corrupt ROMs in the db, I guess.
		</TD>
		<TD>2005-05-01 (UTC)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>integration of SVI-3x8 and Colecovision emulation</TD>
		<TD>	<FONT color="red">Not&nbsp;done</FONT>
		</TD>
		<TD>Maarten</TD>
		<TD>Code is written but not integrated into openMSX yet. Needs quite some work. Might get postponed...
		</TD>
		<TD>2005-01-22 (UTC)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Console not usable after ALT-Enter</TD>
		<TD>	Postpone	
		</TD>
		<TD>Wouter</TD>
		<TD>After pressing ALt-Enter for full screen, the Enter key seems to hang, which makes the console unusable (it doesn't come up). This is an SDL issue, so it has to be postponed...
		</TD>
		<TD>2005-05-02 (UTC)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>"Double screen" effect in deinterlacer</TD>
		<TD>	Postpone
		</TD>
		<TD>Wouter/Maarten</TD>
		<TD>When using the deinterlacer, you can see a 'double screen' after the NOP dice logo in UR. Some info: on the left, it shows the NOP dice. On the right, it shows the MSX boot screen. The NOP dice are compacted (256 pixels wide, not doubled as usual), the MSX boot screen is in its usual resolution (so the left part is missing) and every other line is black. It looks like scanline 100, but I set scanline 0. There is no way the MSX can produce this screen, so it must be a video postprocessing error.
		</TD>

	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Penguin Adventure crashes (sometimes?) on VG 8020/20</TD>
		<TD>	Postpone
		</TD>
		<TD>Maarten</TD>
		<TD>investigated it: the game first initialised the mapper reg save locations (F0F1 and above) and later erases them again. If the game would do those two things in the opposite order, it wouldn't crash. It's heavily timing related. Pressing a key during boot makes the game not crash also.
		</TD>
		<TD>2005-02-06 (UTC)</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>non-standard ways libpng</TD>
		<TD>	Postpone	
		</TD>
		<TD>Maarten</TD>
		<TD>	try to find a way to deal with non-standard ways libpng is packaged. We need such a platform to test on, before we can fix this. (If it's fixable at all...) Until then: it's postponed until further notice.
