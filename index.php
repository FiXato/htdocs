      Web site restyled
    </h2>
    <p>
      A redesign of the openMSX web site was long overdue. And with the
      restructuring of the site, we've also included 2 different layouts.
      Hurray for CSS :-)
    </p>
    <h2>
      <span class="date">2006 July 23</span>
      openMSX needs <em>you</em>!
    </h2>
    <p>
      That is, if you've got some spare time and want to develop
      fun software for Windows. The openMSX team desperately needs Windows
      developers, both for coding on the openMSX code itself, and also for
      Catapult. Don't hesitate! Fire up you IRC client and visit us at
      #openmsx on Freenode.net. We won't bite. Really!
