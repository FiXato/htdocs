      openMSX 0.6.1 released
    </h2>
    <p>
    openMSX 0.6.1&mdash;Chernoton Meltdown&mdash;includes runtime switchable machines and extensions, a lot of new video filters (some of which use pixel shaders), as well as a lot of other improvements and bugfixes. Together with openMSX a new version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. Please <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=435794&group_id=38274">read the release notes</a> for details.

      Web site restyled
    </h2>
    <p>
      A redesign of the openMSX web site was long overdue. And with the
      restructuring of the site, we've also included 2 different layouts.
      Hurray for CSS :-)

      openMSX needs <em>you</em>!
    </h2>
    <p>
      That is, if you've got some spare time and want to develop
      fun software for Windows. The openMSX team desperately needs Windows
      developers, both for coding on the openMSX code itself, and also for
      Catapult. Don't hesitate! Fire up you IRC client and visit us at
      #openmsx on Freenode.net. We won't bite. Really!
