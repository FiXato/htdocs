      No Windows support anymore?? 
    </h2>
    <p>
    We've said it before: we need someone in our team to help us maintain the Windows port of openMSX. At the moment there is no one who provides us structural support for the Windows port. Without a person who can very regularly build and test openMSX and help in case of (rare) Windows specific issues, we cannot maintain the Windows port any longer. We may find a way to build the next release, but even that is uncertain; if we can manage, it will most likely be released (much) later than the Source and Mac versions. If you care and you want to help: please <a href="http://openmsx.sourceforge.net/contact.php">contact us</a> as soon as possible!

      openMSX moves to Subversion
    </h2>
    <p>
    Today we moved the main openMSX project to Subversion (SVN). This means that you have to use a different way to get the latest openMSX sources now. It is explained in the updated online manual, in the <a href="http://openmsx.sf.net/manual/compile.html">Compilation Guide</a>. Snapshots are now also taken from SVN. We removed the snapshot of Catapult, because Catapult as has been released so far is pronounced dead. A rewrite using Python and Qt4 is in the works though. You can get a snapshot of that project, instead.
    </p>
    <p>
    Other news that we forgot to post here: there is a universal binary available for Mac OS X users, see the download section.

      Web site restyled
    </h2>
    <p>
      A redesign of the openMSX web site was long overdue. And with the
      restructuring of the site, we've also included 2 different layouts.
      Hurray for CSS :-)

      openMSX needs <em>you</em>!
    </h2>
    <p>
      That is, if you've got some spare time and want to develop
      fun software for Windows. The openMSX team desperately needs Windows
      developers, both for coding on the openMSX code itself, and also for
      Catapult. Don't hesitate! Fire up you IRC client and visit us at
      #openmsx on Freenode.net. We won't bite. Really!
